        <p class="story"> Hosted by the New Orleans Film Society, <i>Presenting Princess Shaw</i> made its New Orleans debut at the Contemporary Arts Center. In this documentary, Israeli filmmaker Ido Haar sensitively chronicles individual expression and global collaboration through the interwebs. Feature Princess Shaw was present for the Q&amp;A and a post screening performance.</p>
        
        <p class="story">Princess Shaw (Samantha Montgomery) lives in New Orleans. We see her working as an elder caregiver as well as a performer. YouTube (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/KarMaRedd" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/KarMaRedd</a>) is a vehicle for her vulnerable and passionate revelations, musings, and original <i>a capella</i> songs. </p>
        
        <p class="story">Embraced by the art world, musician, composer, producer, and video artist Kutiman (Ophir Kutiel) based in Israel on a kibbutz also uses YouTube. For him, it is source material and repository for remixes and mashups of found audio and video material. His first ‘tube project <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thru-you.com/">Thru You</a> received over 11 million hits as well as critical acclaim. </p>

        <p class="story">Haar is director, cinematographer and editor. In his director’s statement, he asserts: “There are so many people with so much talent, original thinking and unique voices. Most of them weren't born with the ‘right cards in their hand’ and don't really have the access or ability to break into the often exclusive realms of music, art and culture….”</p>

        <p class="story">Princess Shaw understood she was being filmed for a documentary along with other ‘tubers. While shooting her over 1-1/2 to 2 years, Haar in documenting the process of Kutiman’s follow-up project, Thru You Too, chose to focus on her story (Gorbachev). Princess Shaw’s songs and voice are a part of a rich tapestry combining varied social, cultural, musical and performative elements. </p>

        <p class="story">Haar filmed Princess Shaw’s life without disclosing Kutiman’s inclusion of her music (and without re-enactments for the film). Kutiman uses source material without seeking permission, which raises ethical concerns about intellectual property. (He does provide links to original sources, or at least tries to, as these can change). As a documentarian, Haar had more information than Princess Shaw.</p>

        <p class="story">Kutiman and Haar both revel in online interactions as free culture movements (NPR). Kutiman’s YouTube presence (www.youtube.com/kutiman) is not commercial, lacking ads or corporate sponsorships, nor are musicians paid (NPR), although Kutiman has produced an album conventionally. (Kozinn)</p>

        <p class="story">For Haar, “It is not about stardom, but rather about the deeply human experience of being seen—an antidote to the loneliness and anonymity many can feel in a world that is constantly manufacturing new stars. But for me, above all, Kutiman, Princess and all the musicians who appear in the songs suggest a kind of Utopian path, where people from all over the world, especially those who are lacking representation and power, can share, create, express themselves, and maybe give a fight to the cruel, commercially oriented and unfair rules of the game that usually dominate in the worlds of music, art and culture today.”</p>
        
        <p class="story">Princess Shaw and Kutiman have recorded 12 songs for a forthcoming album employing a conventional approach. Princess Shaw plans to explore and pursue opportunities presented to her as well as perform with a forthcoming band. Living in and seeing each moment, she is grounded in her spirit and her arts practice, acknowledging “I march to the beat of my own damn drum.”</p>
